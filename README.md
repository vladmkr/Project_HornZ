Instructions are fairly simple but have to be done for it to work properly.


FiveM icon needs to be placed in the 5th slot on the taskbar.  ( Windows logo being the first, will only work with task bar is on the bottom ) 
Hop into testing or an empty server. 

!! Before runing the program for the first time you need to open the F6 menu and have it selected on vehicle. !!
!! You only need to do this one time after it will work as intented. !!

For best result and to speed up the process, Windowed Mode is recomemed to be used.

The script automatically saves the cars settings.

The instruction for actually using it: (if you need to terminated use windows "exit" button)
run the GTA_HornZ.exe in the dist folder

1# Pick the CLASS you want to change the horns for.
2# The horn you want to select what PAGE & ROW it's in (Ex. PAGE 4, ROW 9 for San Andreas horn).
3# Press RUN wait for it to finish. After it's finished select the next class and run again.
